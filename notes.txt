# Factors to note while documenting
# - Training time, for the dataset
# - Number of layers and the number of neurons in each layer
# - Number of epochs
# - Describe the training set - No of training examples, number of features, etc
# - Learning rate used.
# - Attained accuracy - 93.2692307692% and at what iteration
# - Challenges
# - What next to add : Determining hyper parameters




Issues with Abnormal feature values
- Standardization
- Normalization



# Choosing Hyperparameters
## Learning Rate
- Start with 3 values, and select the one that contributes to better training. Ensure to keep other parameters constant.
- With each value of the cost function, study to see if the cost function is reducing or increasing.
- You can equally use varying learning rates, starting with a large rate, and reducing the learning rate by a factor or a constant value. This is called Learning Rate scheduling.
