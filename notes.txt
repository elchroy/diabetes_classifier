# Factors to note while documenting
# - Training time, for the dataset
# - Number of layers and the number of neurons in each layer
# - Number of epochs
# - Describe the training set - No of training examples, number of features, etc
# - Learning rate used.
# - Attained accuracy - 93.2692307692% and at what iteration
# - Challenges
# - What next to add : Determining hyper parameters




Issues with Abnormal feature values
- Standardization
- Normalization



# Choosing Hyperparameters
## Learning Rate
- Start with 3 values, and select the one that contributes to better training. Ensure to keep other parameters constant.
- With each value of the cost function, study to see if the cost function is reducing or increasing.
- You can equally use varying learning rates, starting with a large rate, and reducing the learning rate by a factor or a constant value. This is called Learning Rate scheduling.

With
sizes = [7, 3000, 30, 1]
lr = 2.5, after 170 epochs, accuracy = 80.7692307692%
lr = 0.25, after 50 epochs, accuracy = 82.6923076923%
lr = 0.025, after 170 epochs, accuracy = 81.7307692308%
So lr = 0.25 is a good start
lr = 0.1375, after 60, 83.6538461538
lr = 0.1375, after 550, 91.3461538462
lr = 0.25, after 550, 92.3076923077
